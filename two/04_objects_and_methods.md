# Objects

* Construct with literals (`{}`, `[]`)
* Or with the `new` operator
* Objects are _stateful_
* Objects have _properties_

# Methods

* Functions are values
* So functions can be properties of objects
* In this case they are called _methods_
* They are said to be 'bound' to the object
* Binding a function to an object sets the special variable `this` within the scope of the function
* `this` defaults to the global object
